I am a researcher using machine learning and data-driven method applied to drug discovery. I did my PhD at The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR), supervised by Dr Nathan Brown and Prof. Julian Blagg using structural bioinformatics to characterise protein binding sites. More recently I have helped build a state-of-the-art platform for supporting drug discovery at BenevolentAI where I was a technical scrum lead for two years, and the strategic AI lead for Chemistry and Target Selection after that.

I am particularly interested bringing real-life problems of applying AI methods to drug discovery closer to the frontier of research, as I believe that the problems that are well-represented in research, are not those that are faced at the coal face of drug discovery.

I believe semi-supervised learning, active learning/bayesian optimisation, explainable AI methods, and uncertainty quantification are some of the most pertinent directions for active ML research in the life sciences.

I am originally from *London*, and love working in buzzing teams of motivated, positively thinking, intelligent people. I'm not sure what else to write on a website, but feel free to check some of the links below because I'm sure this page will quickly go out of date!
